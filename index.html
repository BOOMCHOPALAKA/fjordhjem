                    <h2>Come Find Your<br>Hygge by the Water</h2>
                    <p>Perched 300 feet above Hood Canal's glacial waters, Fjordhjem (that's "Fjord Home" in Norwegian) is where you come to exhale. Wrap yourself in a blanket on the deck, coffee in hand, and watch the mist lift off the mountains. This is the kind of place where time moves differently.</p>
                    <p>Eagles glide past at eye level. The tide whispers its daily rhythm below. Weather systems roll across the Olympics like slow-motion theater. Inside, it's all warm wood, soft throws, and that particular kind of coziness the Scandinavians call hygge. You know the feeling — candles lit, good people, nowhere else you'd rather be.</p>

                        <p>Low tide at Twanoh Falls State Park means one thing: oyster time. Walk down to the beach, pull fresh oysters straight from the canal, shuck them right there with the mountains watching. It doesn't get more Pacific Northwest than this. Pro tip: bring hot sauce and lemon.</p>
