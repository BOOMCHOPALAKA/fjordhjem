  - title: "Harvest Fresh Oysters"
    description: "At low tide, walk down to Twanoh Falls State Park and harvest oysters straight from the canal. Shuck them right there on the beach with the mountains watching. Bring hot sauce and lemon — trust us."

  - title: "Get Out on the Water"
    description: "Twanoh State Park and Union Marina are close by when you want to kayak. Early mornings are glassy calm, sunsets are unbeatable. No rush, no agenda — just you and the mountains reflecting in the water."

  - title: "Wildlife Watching"
    description: "Bald eagles nest nearby and fish the shoreline almost daily. This area is also home to many seals and even the resident orca pods will make their way into the inner hook of the fjord! So grab your coffee and binoculars — the back deck has front-row seats for all of this and more!."

  - title: "Watch the Salmon Run"
    description: "During spawning season, take the short hike to Twanoh Falls and watch thousands of salmon fight their way upstream. It's powerful stuff, and definitely worth the walk."
