label: "Your Retreat"
heading: "Your Hygge Escape on Hood Canal"
paragraph1: "Fjordhjem (Norwegian for \"Fjord Home\") sits 300 feet above Hood Canal (which is, in fact, a fjord!) with Olympic Mountain views that'll make you want to stay on the deck all day. It's the kind of place where your only agenda is coffee in the morning, maybe a hike if you feel like it, and definitely some time around the fire pit at night."
paragraph2: "The cabin sleeps 7 with two bedrooms, a pull-out sofa, and two full bathrooms. Fully stocked kitchen, lots of blankets, and everything you need to either adventure hard or do absolutely nothing. Your call."
